对于Part1来说，重点是流利度，锻炼好基本功，保证说出的句子没有错误即可。答案结构为“回答&#43;两句解释”。需要勤加练习，反应迅速。不用单独准备素材，回答所需的素材从为Part2准备的资料中提取即可。
对于Part2来说，六大类素材，结合自身经历编写，通过“串题”技巧应对各类题目。

最喜欢的东西：书、电影或者网站
人物：一个名人、一个家庭成员
活动：关于爱好的话题、日常的一天、生日或节日怎么过
地点：在哪生活？旅游过的地方？
物品：经常使用的物品？想买的东西？收到的礼物？
事件：一个节日、一个庆祝活动等

“串题”是一种技巧，需要反复练习才会熟练。
这部分是展现口语能力，无须涵盖话题卡上的所有信息点，注重答案本身的逻辑性和结构，表示自己具有用英文交流的能力。
提高答案质量的重要方法是增加细节，举例子。不知道说什么的时候就说“For example”，这个是个有魔力的短语，在说完之后，大脑会逼着自己想出东西的。

减少抽象的高谈阔论，增加具体的细节和技巧。

Part2答案的结构：Intro, what, why, example

最喜欢的东西

There are many things I like, but the one that stands out the most is the the movie Deadpool.
Deadpool is a comedy film that combines superhero elements with a lot of humor. It’s known for its witty and sarcastic dialogue, especially the main character’s sarcastic remarks, which always make me laugh. The film broke away from traditional superhero movies by being more irreverent and self-aware, making it a unique experience for viewers.">

<h3>最喜欢的东西</h3>
<p>电脑、汽车、自行车、《死侍》、抖音</p>
<p>电影《死侍》</p>
<p>There are many things I like, but the one that stands out the most is the the movie <em>Deadpool</em>.</p>
<p><em>Deadpool</em> is a comedy film that combines superhero elements with a lot of humor. It’s known for its witty and sarcastic dialogue, especially the main character’s sarcastic remarks, which always make me laugh. The film broke away from traditional superhero movies by being more irreverent and self-aware, making it a unique experience for viewers.</p>
<p>The reason I love this movie so much is because of its humor. I’m interested in comedy films. Most of them make me happy, and <em>Deadpool</em> takes that humor to another level. The way the film blends sarcasm, dark comedy, and clever writing really appeals to me. I’ve watched it about nine times already, and it still makes me laugh every single time.</p>
<p>For example, just last weekend, I watched Deadpool again on my 55-inch TV at home. I find that even though I’ve seen it many times, I always notice something new or get a fresh laugh from it. It’s the kind of movie that never gets old, and I always enjoy watching it again and again.</p>
</div>
<div id="人物" class="section level3">
<h3>人物</h3>
<p>我的妈妈</p>
<p>There are many people I respect, but the one I admire most is my mom.</p>
<p>I grew up in a single-parent family. In my second year of high school, our family’s factory went bankrupt, leaving us with over a million RMB in debt. At that time, my dad decided to leave and cut off all contact, so it was just my mom and me facing everything alone.</p>
<p>My dad’s choice was extremely disappointing, but it made me appreciate my mon’s strength even more. She took on the responsibility of raising me by herself, supported my education, and encoraged me to pursue my academic dreams, even though we were struggling financially. Her dedication and resilience taught me a lot about how to handle tough situations.</p>
<p>One thing I’ll never forget is how she told me to face challenges directly and never avoid them. Thenks to her, I’ve learned to keep going, no matter how tough things get. I’m truly grateful for everything she’s done, and I hope someday I can repay her for all her scarifices.</p>
</div>
<div id="活动" class="section level3">
<h3>活动</h3>
<p>旅行</p>
<p>There are many activities I enjoy, like watching movies or stand-up comdy, but my favorite one is definitely traveling.</p>
<p>To make traveling easier, I bought a road bike and a second-handle car. I usually spend my free time using them to explore my city, Chengdu, which is located in the west of China. it’s an ideal city with lots of scenic spots, like Chunxi Road, Panda zoo, and Qingcheng Mountanis.</p>
<p>One reason I love traveling is because it allows me to relax and escape from daily pressures. Whenever I’m on the road, I really enjoy the feeling of freedom, just going wherever I want without any fixed destination. Sometime, I’ll even come across breathtaking views of the city or countryside.</p>
<p>For example, last month, when I was driving in the city without a specfic goal, I suddenly wanted to cliff Qingcheng Mountains. So, I changed direction and drove northwest for about two hours to reach this mountains.</p>
<p>It was an unforgettable experience. The fresher air and the view of the top were amazing. Qingcheng Mountain has temples with unique, traditional Chinese architecture, like curved roofs, intricate carvings, and beautiful stone pathways. These temples are surrounded by lush green trees and mountains, creating a peaceful atmosphere that feels almots magical. The combination of nature and architecture makes it a truly memorable place.</p>
<p>At the top of the mountain, I could see the entire city below, bathed in a golden sunset. At that moment, I felt a deep sense of peace, surrounded by nature, and it reminded me why I love traveling so much.</p>
<p>在雅思口语Part 2中，卡片上的所有提示点并<em>不是强制要求</em>。你只需要尽量围绕题目主旨回答，并确保答案连贯、充实。如果有些提示点自然地融入回答中会更好，但如果时间紧张或不容易涉及，也可以不完全包含。重要的是<em>表达的流畅度和内容的深度</em>。</p>
</div>
<div id="地点" class="section level3">
<h3>地点</h3>
<p>我生活的城市——成都</p>
<p>I’d like to talk with you about my city, Chengdu, where is a major city located in the west of China.</p>
<p>Chengdu has many scenic spots, parks, local markets, and, of course, delicious food. It’s also a city with bike lanes around many areas, so it’s easy for me to ride my bike and explore the nearby areas.</p>
<p>One of the things I love about Chengdu is its convenience. There are many spots within easy reach, like Chunxi Road for shopping and local hospitals for healthcare. Or if I feel like escaping the city, I can take a quick drive to places like Qingcheng Mountain to enjoy some time in nature. On weekends, I often drive or bike to nearby scenic spots to relax and get away from the busy city atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, one thing I don’t like about my city is the traffic. There are so many cars, and the city can get quite crowded, especially during rush hours, which makes it difficult to get around quickly in main city areas.</p>
<p>But overall, I really appreciate my city, because it offers both the convenience of city life and easy access to nature, which is something I value a lot.</p>
