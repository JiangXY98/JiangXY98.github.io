    <h1>自编雅思口语素材（Part2）</h1>

    


<p>经过一次考试之后，感觉雅思口语的考试相对模糊。从考生的视角来看，就是进到小房间里和一个外国人说十多分钟的话。只要会说话，能交流，基本就是5分以上的成绩了。当然，想要更高的成绩的话，就需要非常扎实的基本功和丰富的用英语交流的经验了。</p>
<p>对于Part1来说，重点是流利度，锻炼好基本功，保证说出的句子没有错误即可。答案结构为“回答+两句解释”。需要<em>勤加练习，反应迅速</em>。不用单独准备素材，回答所需的素材从为Part2准备的资料中提取即可。</p>
<p>对于Part2来说，六大类素材，结合自身经历编写，通过“串题”技巧应对各类题目。</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>最喜欢的东西：书、电影或者网站</li>
<li>人物：一个名人、一个家庭成员</li>
<li>活动：关于爱好的话题、日常的一天、生日或节日怎么过</li>
<li>地点：在哪生活？旅游过的地方？</li>
<li>物品：经常使用的物品？想买的东西？收到的礼物？</li>
<li>事件：一个节日、一个庆祝活动等</li>
</ol>
<p>“串题”是一种技巧，需要反复练习才会熟练。</p>
<p>这部分是展现口语能力，无须涵盖话题卡上的所有信息点，注重答案本身的<em>逻辑性和结构</em>，表示自己具有用英文交流的能力。</p>
<p>提高答案质量的重要方法是增加细节，举例子。不知道说什么的时候就说“For example”，这个是个有魔力的短语，在说完之后，大脑会逼着自己想出东西的。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>减少抽象的高谈阔论，增加具体的细节和技巧。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part2答案的结构：Intro, what, why, example</p>
<div id="最喜欢的东西" class="section level3">
<h3>最喜欢的东西</h3>
<p>电脑、汽车、自行车、《死侍》、抖音</p>
<p>我的汽车</p>
<p>I’d like to talk about you about my car.</p>
<p>It’s a second-hand car I bought from a lady last month. while it’s not brand new, it’s in great condition and works perfectly for my need, to visit this world on my own.</p>
<p>Since getting this car, I’ve been using it to travel around my city, especially to places like the Qingcheng Mountains. I really love the sense freedom it gives me, allowing me to discover new places end enjoy some peaceful moments on the road.</p>
<p>Just last month, for example, I wanted to watch the sunset, so I drove my car to the Qingcheng Mountains, which are located northwest of my city. The sunset was absolutely gorgeous, with a warm, golden glow over the landscape. It was a peaceful and unforgettable experience, and having my car made it all possible.</p>

<div id="人物" class="section level3">
<h3>人物</h3>
<p>我的妈妈</p>
<p>There are many people I respect, but the one I admire most is my mom.</p>
<p>I grew up in a single-parent family. In my second year of high school, our family’s factory went bankrupt, leaving us with over a million RMB in debt. At that time, my dad decided to leave and cut off all contact, so it was just my mom and me facing everything alone.</p>
<p>My dad’s choice was extremely disappointing, but it made me appreciate my mon’s strength even more. She took on the responsibility of raising me by herself, supported my education, and encoraged me to pursue my academic dreams, even though we were struggling financially. Her dedication and resilience taught me a lot about how to handle tough situations.</p>
<p>One thing I’ll never forget is how she told me to face challenges directly and never avoid them. Thenks to her, I’ve learned to keep going, no matter how tough things get. I’m truly grateful for everything she’s done, and I hope someday I can repay her for all her scarifices.</p>
</div>
<div id="活动" class="section level3">
<h3>活动</h3>
<p>旅行</p>
<p>There are many activities I enjoy, like watching movies or stand-up comdy, but my favorite one is definitely traveling.</p>
<p>For that, I bought a road bike and a second-handle car. I usually spend my free time using them to explore my living city, Chengdu, which is located in the west of China. it’s an ideal city with lots of scenic spots, like Chunxi Road, Panda zoo, and Qingcheng Mountanis.</p>
<p>One reason I love traveling is because it allows me to relax and escape from daily pressures. Whenever I’m on the road, I really enjoy the feeling of freedom. sometime, I’ll even come across breathtaking views of the city or countryside.</p>
<p>For example, last month, when I was driving in the city without goals, I suddenly wanted to cliff Qingcheng Mountains. So I changed direction and drove northwest for about two hours to reach this mountains. It was an unforgettable experience. The fresher air and the view from the top was amazing. I could see the entire city below, bathed in a golden sunset. At that moment, I felt a deep sence of peace, surrounded by nature.</p>
<p>Another reason I love travle is that I always meet interesting people along the way. They often share their stories and experiences, which give me a fresh perspective on life.</p>
